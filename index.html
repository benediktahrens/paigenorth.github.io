<p3>
I am a fourth year PhD student in the Department of Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics and in King's College at the University of Cambridge. My supervisor is Dr Martin Hyland. Before this, I was an undergraduate at the University of Chicago.

<p2>Research</p2>
<br>
<br>
<p3>
I am interested in category theory, homotopy theory, and homotopy type theory. In particular, I am interested in model categories and understanding those which might serve as interpretations of homotopy type theory. In my PhD thesis, I develop the theory of such things - what I call Moore factorization systems for their resemblance to Moore&#8217;s description of the Hurewicz model structure on topological spaces.
